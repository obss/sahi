## Getting Started

If you're new to SAHI:

1. Start with the [prediction utilities](predict.md) to understand basic inference
2. Explore the [slicing utilities](slicing.md) to learn about processing large images
3. Check out the [CLI commands](cli.md) for command-line usage
4. Dive into [COCO utilities](coco.md) for dataset operations
5. Try the interactive notebooks in the [demo directory](../demo/) for hands-on experience
